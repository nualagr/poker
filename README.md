# Modified Rules
For the purposes of this project the rules of Texas Hold'em have been simplified.
There will be no official wagers or bets.
There will be players, each of whom will receive cards.
The standard number of cards will be dealt, which
includes the Flop, the Turn and the River.
Lastly the player with the best hand will be declared the winner.
